<p>Italian librettist. At an early age he ran away to sea; in 1876 he
fought against the Turks. Three years later he settled in Milan and
became well known in literary circles. An ardent republican, he was
associated with the poet Giosue Carducci on a radical literary review.
In 1882 he produced a collection of prose sketches, <i>Farfalle, effetti
di luce</i>, and the following year wrote his first play, <i>I
Narbonnier-Latour</i>, in collaboration with Ferdinando Fontana. His
greatest success in this field was a comedy in Milanese dialect,
<i>L'eriditaa di Felis</i> (1891).

<p>Illica's activity as a librettist began in 1889 with the crudely
melodramatic <i>Il vassallo di Szigeth</i> written for Smareglia. The
association with Puccini began in 1892, when Leoncavallo suggested that
Illica complete the much tormented libretto of <i>Manon Lescaut</i>. As
much of Domenico Oliva's work remained in the final text, including the
entire fourth act, Illica tactfully withheld his name from the
title-page, and the libretto was published without an attribution. In
Puccini's next three operas -- <i>La Bohème</i>, <i>Tosca</i> and
<i>Madama Butterfly</i> -- Illica worked in partnership with the
playwright Giacosa, who versified the dialogue that his colleague had
drafted out. When Giacosa died in 1906 Puccini turned to other
librettists, though he continued to keep Illica employed on the book of
<i>Maria Antonietta</i> which he never set; his failure to do so led to
a permanent breach between them.</p>

<p>Illica's 35 librettos run the gamut of contemporary fashions, from
near- verismo to historical drama, from art nouveau symbolism to
evocations of the commedia dell'arte, and range as far afield as an
adaptation of Thomas Hardy's <i>Tess of the D'Urbevilles</i>. Though
negligible as literature, they show considerable stage sense as well as
invention (he was one of the earliest librettists to devise his own
plots, as in
<i>Andrea Chenier</i> and <i>Siberia</i>). He was especially skilful
with what could be termed the 'dynamic' or 'kinetic' ensemble during
which the action moves forward (e.g. the roll-call of the prostitutes in
<i>Manon Lescaut</i>, the Cafe Momus scene in <i>La Bohème</i>, the
parade of the People's Representatives in <i>Andrea Chenier</i>). Above
all he was instrumental in breaking down the rigid system of Italian
operatic metres into lines of irregular length, which Giacosa jokingly
referred to as 'illicasillabi' but which were eminently suited to the
prevailing musical style.</p>
