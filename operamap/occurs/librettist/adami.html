<p>Italian playwright, librettist and journalist. After graduating in
law at the University of Padua he devoted himself to literature, first
as theatre critic of the <i>Arena</i> (Verona), then as playwright. His
first stage work was the one-act comedy <i>I fioi di Goldoni</i> in
Venetian dialect; thereafter he proved remarkably successful in a
comic-sentimental vein with such plays as <i>Una capanna e il tuo
cuore</i> (1913), <i>Capelli bianchi</i> (1915), <i>Felicita Colombo</i>
(1935) and its sequel <i>Nonna Felicita</i> (1936).</p>

<p>In 1911 he made the acquaintance of Giulio Ricordi, head of the
publishing firm, of whom he left a valuable memoir in his <i>Giulio
Ricordi e i suoi musicisti</i> (Milan, 1933, 2/1945 as <i>Giulio
Ricordi, amico dei musicisti</i>). It was Ricordi who first put him in
touch with Puccini, who briefly considered setting his Spanish-derived
libretto <i>Anima allegra</i> written with Luigi Motta; it was
eventually set by Franco Vittadini, for whom Adami wrote a number of
ballet scenarios.</p>

<p>His first collaboration with Puccini was on <i>La rondine</i> (1917),
which he adapted as a full-length verse libretto from a German operetta
text by Willner and Reichert. There followed <i>Il tabarro</i> (1918)
and <i>Turandot</i> (1926), the last being written in partnership with
Renato Simoni.</p>

<p>To Adami we owe the first collection of Puccini's letters to be
published, <i>Giacomo Puccini: epistolario</i> (Milan, 1928; Eng.
trans., 1931, 2/1974), as well as one of the earliest biographies of the
composer (Milan, 1935), based on personal recollections. From 1931 to
1934 he was music critic for <i>La sera</i> (Milan) and of the review
<i>La comedia</i>. To the end of his life he maintained a connection
with the house of Ricordi, for whom he acted as publicist.</p>
