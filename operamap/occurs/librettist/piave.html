<p>Italian librettist. The son of a glass-maker, he studied for the
church before obtaining employment as a proofreader. On the failure of
his father's business he went to Rome, where he joined a literary circle
that included the librettist Jacopo Ferretti, with whom he remained on
close terms. He returned to his old position in Venice in 1838, and in
1842 wrote a libretto, <i>Don Marzio</i>, for Samuel Levi, but it was
not performed. He also provided the third act of Pacini's <i>Il duca
d'Alba</i>, which Giovanni Peruzzini had been prevented by illness from
completing. The autograph survives, heavily corrected by the composer.
Piave was recommended to Verdi by Count Mocenigo, and there began a long
and successful collaboration from <i>Ernani</i> (1844) to <i>La forza
del destino</i> (1862). Following a period as poet and stage director at
La Fenice, Piave moved in 1859 to Milan, where on Verdi's recommendation
he obtained the corresponding position at La Scala. On 5 December 1867,
on the way to La Scala for a rehearsal, he suffered a stroke which
deprived him of speech and movement; he lingered on for nine years in
this condition, leaving unfinished a libretto (<i>Vico Bentivoglio</i>)
for Ponchielli.</p>

<p>Verdi was initially unsure of Piave's abilities and always harried
him unmercifully, often having his work revised by others; Piave
rewarded him with doglike devotion, and the two remained on terms of
sincere friendship. He was frequently summoned to Verdi's side, and they
worked together on librettos. Both Verdi and his wife came generously to
Piave's aid in his last years.</p>

<p>Throughout his career Piave wrote for many other composers, some well
known like Pacini, but most of them insignificant. There is, however, a
wide gulf between Piave's Verdian and non-Verdian librettos. Most of the
latter are of poor quality and, with the possible exception of
<i>Elisabetta di Valois</i> (Antonio Buzzolla, 1850; a precursor of
<i>Don Carlos</i>) and the extraordinary black comedy <i>Crispino e la
comare</i> (Luigi and Federico Ricci, 1850), might almost have come from
another hand: both dramatic tension and crispness of versification are
absent. Verdi, however, used to give Piave explicit instructions on what
he wanted, and often wrote out in prose the passages he needed to have
versified. Piave had a wide vocabulary and a facile pen, and an uncanny
ability for turning Verdi's drafts into verse with an economy of words
that satisfied Verdi's insistence on brevity and provided him with the
striking, illuminating expressions he sought. It was Piave's willingness
to meet Verdi's detailed requirements which provided the basis of their
work together, and it is on this partnership that his reputation as a
librettist must rest.</p>
