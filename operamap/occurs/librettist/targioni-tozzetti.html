<p>Italian librettist. He was a professional journalist who became a
newspaper editor and filled a number of public appointments. His
earliest libretto seems to have been <i>Pinotta</i>, written for
Mascagni in the early 1880s; the score was lost for 50 years. Then came
<i>Cavalleria rusticana</i>, a work which, like all of
Targioni-Tozzetti's, shows a strong sense of the theatre. In this, as in
a number of his subsequent librettos, he worked with Guido Menasci (b
Livorno, 1867). it was said that while Targioni-Tozzetti was responsible
for the passionate, dramatic sections, Menasci supplied the more
elegant, restrained ones. Targioni-Tozzetti was responsible for the
first Italian translation of Massenet's <i>Werther</i>, and the Italian
version of Mascagni's <i>Amica</i>, the composer's only work to a French
text. He is sometimes credited (for example by Loewenberg) with a share
in the libretto of Mascagni's <i>Il piccolo Marat</i> but the libretto
carries the name of Forzano alone. In 1900 Targioni-Tozzetti and Menasci
published a libretto <i>Vistilia</i>, 'scene liriche per la musica di
Pietro Mascagni', but nothing seems to have come of it. In it they also
listed five other librettos in preparation but none of them was heard of
again.</p>
