  tmcl-validator
==================

This is meant as a reference implementation of TMCL, exactly mirroring
how TMCL is described in the standard. Thus, it should serve both as a
mechanism for verifying the standard, and as a testbed for the
conformance test suite.

In addition, it can also be used as a real TMCL validator, but this is
not a design goal, and very likely it will only handle topic maps of
limited size. Further, error messages may leave something to be
desired.
