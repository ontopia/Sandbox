This is the conversion scripts that were written together with Lars
Marius Garshol's "TMCL and OWL" paper from TMRA 2008:
  http://tmra.de/2008/talks/tmcl-and-owl.html

The scripts are written in Jython and can convert both from TMCL to
OWL, and vice versa. However, they are somewhat out of date, as they
rely on an old TMCL draft. They need to be updated to the latest
draft.
